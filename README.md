IDEA:
Precaution from Tsunami:
We the team FAB3 are enriched to design a technology for saving lives and loves of sailing people.
We all know that ships sailing from different countries have to stay alive in deep oceans for several days.
During their stay in mid ocean,there are chances for sudden Tsunami.This may cause lots of deaths due to toppling of ship in mid ocean.
Our technology is to identify the sudden Tsunami by gathering information from weather stations nearby the ship's location by 
using gps and help save a lot of lives.
From the information received ,some already planted chips will notify the captain of the ship and help people transfer themselves into small submarine like lifeboats which will save them from the mighty Tsunami.
